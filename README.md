# Emerging Technology Analysis Canvas

The rate of technology change is getting faster. To survive in this fast-changing world, both the organizations and practitioners must understand both the current technology landscape as well as its ebbs and flows. Every year, as a part of annual planning, most organizations make these decisions.

Although it is a regular decision, which many organizations must make yearly, there is no widely accepted framework for evaluating emerging technologies.

We present “Emerging Technology Analysis Canvas” (ETAC), a framework to assess an individual emerging technologies.

 Inspired by the Business Model Canvas, It represents different aspects of technology visually on a single page. This approach includes a set of questions that probe the technology arranged around a logical narrative. The visual representation is concise, compact, and comprehensible at a glance. 

It provides 
* a logical framework to assess the emerging technologies
* a framework to teach, to learn, and to discuss different aspects of the technology
* as a brainstorming tool when trying to understand emerging technologies.

You can find more details from [ETAC specification](https://github.com/wso2/ETAC/blob/master/ETAC.md).
