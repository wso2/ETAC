It represents different aspects of technology visually on a single page inspired by the Business Model Canvas. This approach includes a set of questions that probe the technology arranged around a logical narrative. The visual representation is concise, compact, and comprehensible at a glance. 

We propose that ETAC can provide a logical framework to understand a technology; provide a framework to teach, learn, and discuss different aspects of an emerging technology; and can be used as a brainstorming tool when trying to understand emerging technologies.

You can find more details from [ETAC paper](https://github.com/wso2/ETAC/blob/master/ETAC.md).
